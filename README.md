Quick Sort vs Bucket Sort vs Insertion Sort vs Heap Sort vs Merge Sort vs Shell Sort


Details:
 Generated a report showing runs of various sizes and the resulting running times for each of these:  bucket sort, quick sort, insertion sort.

     After running the program, created a line graph (in Excel) that plots the running times.  Include in the graph the lines for N, N Log N, N*N, for comparison.
